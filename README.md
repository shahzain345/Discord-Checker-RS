# Discord Checker

A discord token checker written in rust.

Very fast

Only checks if the token is valid or not, if it is it appends to `working.txt`

# Building from source:

First make sure you install the rust compiler [RustC](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), after that cd into the directory and run the below command:

```
cargo run
```

This command will compile the files and run it.
